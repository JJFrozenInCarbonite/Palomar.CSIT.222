### Problem Statement
Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon of spring. To compute
the date, you can use this algorithm, invented by the mathematician Carl Friedrich
Gauss in 1800:
1. Let y be the year (such as 1800 or 2001).
2. Divide y by 19 and call the remainder a. Ignore the quotient.
3. Divide y by 100 to get a quotient b and a remainder c.
4. Divide b by 4 to get a quotient d and a remainder e.
5. Divide 8 * b + 13 by 25 to get a quotient g. Ignore the remainder.
6. Divide 19 * a + b - d - g + 15 by 30 to get a remainder h. Ignore the quotient.
7. Divide c by 4 to get a quotient j and a remainder k.
8. Divide a + 11 * h by 319 to get a quotient m. Ignore the remainder.
9. Divide 2 * e + 2 * j - k - h + m + 32 by 7 to get a remainder r. Ignore the quo-
tient.
10. Divide h - m + r + 90 by 25 to get a quotient n. Ignore the remainder.
11. Divide h - m + r + n + 19 by 32 to get a remainder p. Ignore the quotient.

Then Easter falls on day p of month n. For example, if y is 2001:
\\n\\ta = 6 g = 6 m = 0 n = 4
\\n\\tb = 20, c = 1 h = 18 r = 6 p = 15
\\n\\td = 5, e = 0 j = 0, k = 1

Therefore, in 2001, Easter Sunday fell on April 15. Write a program that prompts the\n
user for a year and prints out the month and day of Easter Sunday.

### Problem Statement
Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your program’s
inputs should be:
* The cost of a new car
* The estimated miles driven per year
* The estimated gas price
* The estimated resale value after 5 years.

Compute the total cost of owning the car for 5 years. (For simplicity, we will not take the
cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid and
a comparable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using today’s gas price and
15,000 miles per year. Include pseudocode and the program runs with your assignment

### Psuedo Code
a. Get the price of the car from the user
b. Get the user's estimate mileage
c. Get the estimated price of gas from the user
d. Get the estimated resale value after 5 years from the user
e. Total Cost = (a - d) + (b * c)
f. Display the value from e to the user
